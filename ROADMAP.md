# Extended Properties — roadmap

**Status: v3.8.0.** The original feature roadmap (milestones 1–6) is fully
implemented, and forward-roadmap items **L1 (history & safe sync, v3.1.0)**,
**G2 (inline charts & sparklines, v3.2.0)** and **M1 (accessibility completion,
v3.6.0)** have shipped. Releases v3.3.0–v3.5.5 added the 3D-dice presentation plus
a run of roll, mobile and robustness polish (see *Dice presentation & polish*
below). v3.7.0–v3.8.0 were quality passes over a codebase audit (see *Hardening
pass* and *Audit fixes* below); their findings drove a re-planning of the
forward roadmap into **milestones 12–17** — sequenced by dependency, with
sizes, risks and done-when criteria — at the bottom of this document. This
document is consolidated: it records what shipped — without the original
per-feature planning notes — and lays out the sequenced forward plan.

Legend: ✅ done · ◑ partial · ○ planned.

The architecture to protect throughout (unchanged): the registry system
(`src/core/registry.ts`) that decouples value types, entry kinds, cluster addons,
derivations, templates and presets from the shell; the generic influence /
expression engine (`src/core/influences.ts`, `src/core/expr.ts`); feature modules
that self-register and self-migrate; and the pure-function split (`src/utils/*`,
most of `src/core/*`) that keeps Obsidian out of the math and under unit test. See
[ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

---

## Shipped (milestones 1–6) ✅

A consolidated summary; see the git history and releases for detail.

- **Engine & expressions** — A1 expression engine (references by name / short
  form, function library, explicit cycle detection); C1 validation & constraints;
  C2 conditional visibility (`showWhen` / `evalCondition`); B2 cross-note
  references & aggregates (`[[Note]].Prop`, `prop()`, `sum/avg/count/min/max`)
  over a `PropertyIndex`, with a settings kill-switch.
- **Rolling** — A2 full dice notation + roll AST (keep/drop, explode, reroll,
  success counting, property references); A3 saved roll macros (palette commands,
  per-type scope); A4 persistent roll history (panel, current-note filter,
  Markdown export); per-category sound effects + configurable roll animation.
- **Notes integration** — B1 inline rolls & properties (`roll:` / `prop:` /
  `val:` / `vals:` and the `ep-sheet` block, in reading mode and Live Preview);
  E2 mobile refinements; `[[`-triggered note autocomplete in text / list inputs.
- **Value types & data** — C3 rating / link / unit / datetime value types plus
  `today()` / `days()`; D1 export / import of types & sections; D4 write batching
  + mtime conflict guard.
- **Scale & UI** — B3 type table view (sort / filter / persist, in-cell edit and
  rolls, row virtualization); F2 performance hardening (signature-cached
  responsive pass, tier-major batched reads).
- **Platform** — F1 test harness (Vitest over the pure modules); F3 CI + release
  automation + community-submission runbook; E3 theming surface (`--ep-*` +
  Style Settings); F4 i18n as data (JSON dictionaries + parity checker); F5
  public module API (`src/api.ts`, `apiVersion` 1); D2 layouts as vault files;
  E1 keyboard navigation & screen-reader support; D3 versioned settings
  migrations + pre-upgrade backups.

### Cross-version durability (v3.0.0) ✅

User customizations carry across upgrades intact. `normalizeSettings` now
preserves unknown / forward-compatible keys — settings written by a newer
version, or top-level keys saved by a third-party module through the public API —
instead of dropping them on a load → save round-trip. Settings carry an
`appVersion` stamp, and any version change snapshots `data.json` to the plugin's
`backups/` folder even when the schema is unchanged, so a release can always be
rolled back. Together with D3's migration table and D2's vault-file layouts, this
makes the data path safe to evolve.

### Trust & safe sync (v3.1.0) ✅

L1 shipped three data-safety features. **Config history snapshots** write a
timestamped JSON of your types, layouts, derivations and settings to a
`snapshots/` subfolder — a manual command, an optional daily auto-snapshot, a
retention cap, and a restore picker that backs up the current settings first.
**Field-level three-way merge** upgrades the D4 conflict guard: when an external
edit and your edits touch *different* frontmatter keys they merge automatically,
and the *Keep mine / Take theirs* prompt is reserved for keys both sides changed
differently (now listed by name). **Opt-in value encryption** (`core/secure.ts`)
encrypts a sensitive text property with AES-256-GCM under a session passphrase;
the value is stored as a self-describing envelope, shown masked until unlocked,
and a wrong passphrase fails closed — decryption is always non-destructive.

### Visualization (v3.2.0) ✅

G2 added lightweight charts. Pure SVG geometry (`utils/chart.ts`, unit-tested)
feeds a DOM renderer (`ui/render/charts.ts`) that themes through `--ep-*` and is
accessible (every chart is `role="img"` with an `aria-label` and a visually-hidden
text fallback). Four inline tokens render in reading mode and Live Preview —
`` `spark: a, b, c` ``, `` `bar: …` ``, `` `radar: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA` ``
and `` `progress: HP / MaxHP` `` — and an `ep-chart` code block takes a small
`type` / `props` / `max` / `title` config for a larger chart. All references
resolve through the existing engine, so short forms, modifier suffixes and
cross-note references work. *Deferred:* a chart cell in the type table view
(needs per-column type config) remains a follow-up.

### Dice presentation & polish (v3.3.0–v3.5.5) ✅

The 3D dice roll grew from an idea into real geometry. `utils/polyhedra.ts`
(pure, unit-tested) builds the standard solids — tetrahedron (d4), cube (d6),
octahedron (d8), pentagonal trapezohedron (d10), dodecahedron (d12) and
icosahedron (d20) — via convex-hull face extraction, emitting per-face
`place` / `land` / `clip` matrices so a die lands with the result face front and
upright. The roll animation is **modular** (`features/rolling/dice-styles.ts`):
classic cycling numbers, a spinning icon, or the 3D solid, selectable in
Settings → Dice. The 3D die plays **one continuous decelerating spin on a single
axis** that overshoots the landing slightly (a bounce) before settling, and
honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.

Alongside it: rolls resolve in an on-screen **dialog** that *replaces* the result
Notice while enabled (history and the a11y announce are kept); on mobile the roll
cards **wrap into as many columns as fit the screen and scroll vertically**
instead of one horizontal row, and the numeric `−`/`+` steppers get a wider grid
column so the larger mobile touch targets no longer overlap. A supersampling
anti-alias path for the 3D dice exists but is currently **disabled** (it distorted
the dice under CSS 3D; the toggle is locked off pending a different approach).
Robustness passes hardened the data path — a corrupt `data.json` now falls back to
defaults and is backed up rather than bricking load, snapshot / inline-render
parsing is guarded, and vault-local `data.json` is no longer tracked in git or
shipped in release zips, so an update can never overwrite live settings.

### Hardening pass (v3.7.0) ✅

A codebase audit (build/tests, dead code, settings validation, test coverage)
turned up a real perf risk and a couple of gaps, all now fixed. **PropertyIndex
caching:** every cross-note `sum()/avg()/prop()` reference used to trigger a
fresh `vault.getMarkdownFiles()` scan of the *entire vault* on every sidebar
render; `PropertyIndex` now keeps a per-file frontmatter snapshot cache, built
lazily and kept in sync via `metadataCache.changed` / `vault.delete` /
`vault.rename`, so a render only pays the full-scan cost once per file change
rather than once per render. This is the first half of N1 below — the cache
removes the redundant re-scanning, but aggregates are still recomputed on every
read rather than memoized, which is what N1 now tracks. **Settings validation:**
`inlineEntries` (the data backing `ep-sheet` note blocks) was the one settings
field with no shape-check on load; it's now validated the same way every other
typed field is. **Test coverage:** added unit tests for the three pure modules
that had none — `utils/formula.ts`, `utils/color.ts`, `core/layout-ops.ts` (34
new tests, 160/160 passing). Everything else the audit checked — dead code,
TODOs, i18n coverage, the deprecation state below — came back clean.

### Audit fixes (v3.7.1–v3.8.0) ✅

The deep-read audit that followed v3.7.0 found eight concrete gaps; all shipped
across two releases. **v3.7.1 — the table view joins the safe paths:** cell and
checkbox edits write through a single plugin-wide `NoteFacade` (batched,
conflict-guarded, three-way-merged) instead of raw `processFrontMatter`; rows
are served from the `PropertyIndex` snapshot cache — no vault re-scan per
render or filter keystroke — with refreshes scoped to files that are (or were)
rows of the shown type; and pending inline/table writes flush on plugin unload
(`NoteFacade.flushAll`), closing a small data-loss window. **v3.8.0 — quality
pass:** edit-session undo awaits its writes and surfaces failures; settings
load structurally validates `types` and `layouts` (the shape-checking
`inlineEntries` got in v3.7.0, now with tests); the type table became
keyboard-accessible (header sort is a real button with `aria-sort`, cells edit
with Enter/Space, resize grips are focusable separators — see
ACCESSIBILITY.md); a new `ClusterAddon.onRename` hook moved the last
feature-owned field knowledge out of the core view; `showWhen` conditions
evaluate once per refresh pass; and roll history moved out of `data.json` into
its own `roll-history.json` (one-time migration), so a settings save no longer
reserializes hundreds of roll records.

## Deprecations

- **German locale (`de`) — removed in v2.41.** English-only; the locale
  *mechanism* (the `register` API and the per-string override editor) is kept, so
  a community-maintained dictionary can be slotted back in under F4. Any vault
  still set to `de` resolves entirely through the English fallback.
- **Legacy `skills` value type — deprecated (F5).** The one-click *Convert to
  property entries* converter ships and the type shows a deprecation notice.
  Removal (with a read-only fallback for unconverted data) is reserved for a
  future major and is explicitly gated on the cross-version durability guarantee
  above, so no data is lost.

## Shipped beyond the original plan

Per-property unique short forms with name↔short-form interchangeability and
autocomplete; the dotted modifier suffix (`INT.s`, `[[Note]].intelligence.s`,
configurable); the inline `vals:` card that reuses the sidebar value-type
renderers with a per-reference options store; and `[[`-note autocomplete across
sidebar, inline and table inputs.

---

## Forward-looking roadmap

**Re-planned after v3.8.0.** Milestones 7–11 (the first forward plan) are
superseded by **milestones 12–17** below. Every item id carries over — nothing
was dropped — but items are regrouped by *dependency* rather than by theme,
and each milestone now states a goal, a done-when, and per-item sizes.
Nothing here is committed; it is a design backlog in build order.

Item format stays **What · Considerations · Barriers · Touchpoints · Steps**.
Sizes are rough: **S** fits a patch/point release, **M** a minor release,
**L** spans releases.

### Dependencies (why this order)

- **Milestone 12 — Foundations** gates everything that touches performance or
  the data path: N2's benchmark is the acceptance gate for N1's memoization,
  and F6's seam tests protect exactly the write paths L2 and H1 will modify.
  It is also the cheapest milestone — it pays for itself at the next audit.
- **Milestone 13 — Query & visualize** needs N1's aggregate scale (12) and
  produces the shared cell renderer its own G3 — and later work — reuses.
- **Milestone 14 — Relationships & authoring** builds on the index layers
  from 12/13 (relation edges are a third consumer of the same invalidation
  seam).
- **Milestone 15 — Value history & conflicts** extends the write seam F6 has
  pinned down; doing it before F6 would mean modifying an untested data path.
- **Milestone 16 — Interaction polish** is independent; slot into any release.
- **Milestone 17 — Ecosystem & listing** is ongoing; the directory submission
  (P1) makes sense once 12 has landed (a stability story to tell reviewers)
  and does not need to wait for 13.

### Release mapping (indicative, not committed)

- **v3.9.0** — shipped between the re-plan and Milestone 12: user-driven UI
  work (section pin zones — header / body / footer with capped, internally
  scrolling zones — plus the roll-screen overhaul: centered cards, dismissal
  reflow and growth animations, and the summary's expandable settings panel).
- **v3.10.0** — shipped: vault-wide (per-key) property data types with a
  one-time unification migration, plus the edit-mode data-type switcher on
  the type hint.
- **Next free minor** — Milestone 12 (N2, F6, N1 completion). User-driven UI
  work keeps slotting in ahead of the plan (v3.9–v3.11 so far); the milestone
  takes the first minor with room rather than a pinned number.
- **v4.0.0** — Milestone 13 (G1 query blocks + G3 chart cells) — the flagship
  release; the shared-renderer extraction is the largest internal refactor
  since the registry split, which is what earns the major.
- **v4.1.x** — Milestone 14 (H1, H2).
- **v4.2.x** — Milestone 15 (L2).
- Milestone 16 items (M2, R1) ride whichever train has room; Milestone 17
  runs continuously, with P1 targeted right after Milestone 12 lands.

### Risk register (cross-cutting)

Likelihood/impact: L low · M medium · H high.

| Risk | Where it bites | L | I | Mitigation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Private Obsidian APIs drift (`metadataTypeManager`, `commands.removeCommand`) | property-type detection, macro commands | M | M | Both call sites are try/catch-guarded and degrade gracefully; F6's stub pins the expected shapes so a break becomes a failing test, not a user report. |
| Committed `main.js` drifts from `src/` | manual + BRAT installs ship stale code | M | M | Happened twice before v3.7.1 (bundle lagged a release). N2 adds a CI guard that rebuilds and diffs the bundle. |
| Performance claims stay unmeasured | N1, G1, any large vault | M | H | N2 lands first; assert on scaling and call counts, never wall-clock in CI. |
| Cache-invalidation bugs | N1 aggregate cache, N1 type buckets, H1 relation edges | M | H | Every cache hangs off the one existing invalidation seam (`invalidateFile`/`invalidatePath`); the `crossNote` kill-switch stays the user-facing escape hatch; fixture tests per cache layer. |
| Data loss at the write seam | D4 queue, three-way merge, unload flushes, L2 journal, history migration | L | H | All writes funnel through `NoteModel`/`NoteFacade` since v3.7.1 — one seam to test; F6 covers it before L2 builds on it. |
| G1 scope creep ("a query language") | Milestone 13 | H | M | Declarative block schema with a handful of keys, no free grammar; differentiate on *typed, editable* cells (Dataview owns read-only queries); grouping is explicitly out of v1. |
| a11y regressions | every UI release | M | M | ACCESSIBILITY.md manual checklist per release; M2 extends coverage; F6's jsdom smoke step can pin roles/labels later. |
| Community-review friction | P1 | M | M | Pre-submission self-review: the `window.ExtendedProperties` global, the two private-API call sites and command naming are the likely flags — prepare rationale or alternatives before submitting. |
| Single-locale i18n debt | non-English users | L | L | The locale *mechanism* and parity checker are kept (F4); community dictionaries can slot back in without code changes. |

### Milestone 12 — Foundations: measure, test, finish the index ○ (next free minor)

**Goal.** Turn the two things the v3.7.0–v3.8.0 audits could only check by
reading code — performance and the Obsidian seam — into things a failing check
catches automatically, then finish N1 against that gate.
**Done when.** The benchmark suite runs in CI with scaling assertions; the
data-loss-risk flows run under Vitest against the vault fake; aggregate reads
no longer re-reduce the full snapshot set on the benchmark fixture; CI fails
on a stale `main.js`.

#### N2 — Performance benchmark & regression harness ○ (S)

- **What.** A reproducible large-vault benchmark: a synthetic fixture
  generator (N notes × M types, cross-note references, aggregates) plus timed
  runs of the index build, snapshot reads and aggregate evaluation — runnable
  locally and as a CI job, so the next regression like the pre-v3.7.0
  full-vault re-scan (or the table view's copy of it, fixed in v3.7.1) is a
  failing number instead of a code-reading find.
- **Considerations.** The measured paths are pure (`core/property-index.ts`,
  `core/expr.ts`, `core/influences.ts`) — no Obsidian API needed. Vitest's
  `bench` mode or a plain script both work. The fixture doubles as the
  acceptance gate for N1's memoization, and later for G1's executor.
- **Barriers.** CI runner noise makes absolute wall-clock thresholds flaky —
  assert on *scaling* (a render-path read must not grow with vault size) and
  on call counts, never milliseconds; keeping the synthetic vault
  representative of real frontmatter shapes.
- **Touchpoints.** New `tests/bench/`; `vitest.config.ts`;
  `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
- **Steps.** Fixture generator → benchmark the index build / read / aggregate
  paths → scaling assertions → CI job → also in CI: rebuild `main.js` and
  fail when the committed bundle differs (it drifted a release behind twice
  before v3.7.1).

#### F6 — Integration tests over the Obsidian seam ○ (M)

- **What.** The pure modules sit at 162 unit tests, but the seam — the write
  queue, the three-way merge, settings load, the unload flushes, the
  roll-history migration — is verified only by hand, and v3.7.1/v3.8.0 grew
  it. Extend `tests/stubs/obsidian.ts` into a fuller fake (vault files,
  metadata cache, change events) so whole flows run under Vitest.
- **Considerations.** Extend the stub per flow, not into an emulator.
  Priority order = data-loss risk: batch write → merge/conflict; corrupt
  `data.json` → defaults + backup; `flushAll`/`flushPending` on unload; the
  one-time roll-history migration; `revertUndo`. Assert on observable
  outcomes (file contents, settings state), never on stub internals.
- **Barriers.** Fake fidelity vs. maintenance cost; DOM-heavy render flows
  need jsdom — keep those to a later smoke step; the classic risk of testing
  the stub instead of the plugin.
- **Touchpoints.** `tests/stubs/obsidian.ts`; `vitest.config.ts`;
  `core/note-model.ts`, `core/merge.ts`, `core/settings.ts`,
  `features/rolling/history.ts`.
- **Steps.** Stub vault + metadata events → batch-write & merge flow tests →
  corrupt-load tests → unload-flush tests → history-migration test →
  optional jsdom render smoke.

#### N1 — Aggregate memoization & large-vault scale ◑ (M)

- **What.** Memoize cross-note aggregates with dependency tracking, add
  per-type file buckets, and optionally move heavy aggregation to a worker
  for very large vaults.
- **Shipped so far.** The per-file frontmatter snapshot cache (v3.7.0) and
  its second consumer, the table view's `rowsByType` (v3.7.1). **Remaining:**
  every `sum()/avg()/count()` call still re-filters and re-reduces the full
  snapshot set on every read, and `rowsByType` scans all snapshots rather
  than a type bucket.
- **Considerations.** Two layers riding the same invalidation events the
  snapshot cache already uses: a type → files bucket index (serves
  `rowsByType` and aggregate candidate sets) and an aggregate cache keyed
  `(type, key, fn)` with dirty flags. N2's fixture is the acceptance gate. A
  worker can't touch the Obsidian API, so it only ever receives plain
  serialized data — gate it behind a vault-size threshold.
- **Barriers.** Invalidation breadth is the classic hard part: an aggregate
  over `(type, key)` must invalidate when any note of that type changes `key`
  *or* its `Type` list — bucket moves are the subtle case (a note gaining or
  losing a type must dirty both buckets). Worker serialization can cost more
  than it saves on small vaults.
- **Touchpoints.** `core/property-index.ts` (buckets + aggregate cache);
  `core/influences.ts` (aggregate call sites); build config (optional worker
  entry).
- **Steps.** Type buckets → aggregate cache + invalidation → verify on the N2
  fixture → optional worker behind a threshold.

### Milestone 13 — Query & visualize ○ (target v4.0)

**Goal.** The flagship: vault data as live, *editable* views inside notes.
**Done when.** An `ep-query` block filters, sorts and renders notes of a type
with type-aware, in-place-editable cells; table columns can render charts;
both reuse a single shared cell-renderer module; render cost on the N2
fixture is bound by the index, not by vault size.

#### G1 — Query blocks (`ep-query`) ○ (L)

- **What.** A code block that queries notes by type and property predicates and
  renders the result as a table, list or cards — `from "Character" where Level >= 5
  sort by Dexterity desc`. Columns are properties; cells use the same type-aware
  widgets as the table view and edit in place.
- **Considerations.** Almost every part now exists: `evalCondition` for the
  `where` clause, `PropertyIndex.rowsByType()` (v3.7.1) for the candidate set
  (N1's type buckets make it cheap), the table view's cell renderers for
  output, the shared `NoteFacade` for in-place edits, and the aggregate
  functions for summary rows. A small declarative block schema — a handful of
  keys — beats inventing a query language. For live refresh, generalize the
  table view's scoped-refresh pattern (v3.7.1): skip the rebuild unless the
  changed file is, or was, in the result set.
- **Barriers.** Scope creep is the top risk (see register): the v1 line is
  filter → sort → render, no grouping. Re-render thrash on vault events
  (debounce + the scoped check). Overlap with Dataview — differentiate on
  *typed, editable* cells rather than read-only output. Performance is gated
  on N1 (Milestone 12).
- **Touchpoints.** New `src/features/query/`; extract `renderValue` and its
  helpers out of `ui/table-view.ts` into a shared `ui/render/cells.ts`;
  `core/property-index.ts`; `core/expr.ts`.
- **Steps.** Extract the shared cell renderer (G3 shares this step) → block
  schema (`from` / `where` / `columns` / `sort` / `render`) → index-backed
  executor → render modes (table / list / cards) → in-place edit through the
  facade → scoped live refresh → respect the cross-note kill-switch.

#### G3 — Chart cells in the table view ○ (S)

- **What.** Per-column display configuration in the type table so a numeric
  column can render as a sparkline, bar or progress cell — the follow-up G2
  explicitly deferred for lack of per-column type config.
- **Considerations.** The geometry (`utils/chart.ts`) and renderer
  (`ui/render/charts.ts`) are pure, cheap SVG — that matters because
  virtualized rows re-render on every scroll window. Persist the choice in
  `TableLayout` (a `display` map beside `widths`), riding the existing
  per-type persistence.
- **Barriers.** Config surface in the header menu; chart legibility at ~29 px
  row height; keeping cell cost flat under row virtualization.
- **Touchpoints.** `ui/table-view.ts` (column model); the shared cell module
  from G1; `core/model.ts` (`TableLayout.display`).
- **Steps.** Column display model → header-menu config → sparkline / progress
  cell renderers in the shared module → persistence.

*G2 — inline charts & sparklines — shipped in v3.2.0 (see the Visualization
entry above); G3 is its recorded deferral.*

### Milestone 14 — Relationships & authoring ○ (target v4.1)

**Goal.** Notes that know about each other, and one-command note creation from
a type.
**Done when.** A `relation` value type with a lazily maintained inverse works
through the index; `backlinks()` / `relatedTo()` resolve in expressions; a
*New \<Type\> note* command scaffolds a note with the type's properties and an
optional body template.

#### H1 — Typed relations & backlinks ○ (L)

- **What.** A first-class `relation` value type: a link property with a declared
  inverse, plus expression accessors — `backlinks()`, `relatedTo("Faction")` — and
  derived "referenced by" counts/lists, so a note can compute over the notes that
  point at it.
- **Considerations.** Store relations as ordinary link properties (portable, no
  hidden state). Maintain the inverse *lazily* through the index: relation
  edges live beside the frontmatter snapshot cache and invalidate through the
  same `invalidateFile` / `invalidatePath` seam — a third consumer of the
  wiring N1's buckets already share, no new events. Reuse the expression
  engine's cycle detection for relation chains.
- **Barriers.** Eager inverse writes would cause write storms — optional
  inverse maintenance must ride the shared `NoteFacade` batch queue with its
  echo suppression (v3.7.1 made that queue plugin-wide); edge correctness on
  rename/delete (the invalidation seam already handles both); cross-note
  reads stay cycle-free because they read raw stored values.
- **Touchpoints.** `core/property-index.ts` (edge map); `core/expr.ts`
  (relation functions); new `relation` value type in the registry;
  `core/note-model.ts` (opt-in inverse writes).
- **Steps.** Relation value type → index relation edges → expression accessors →
  backlink-derived properties → optional (opt-in) inverse maintenance.

#### H2 — Note scaffolding from types ○ (M)

- **What.** A *New \<Type\> note* command that creates a note pre-stamped with the
  type's properties (empty, hidden from Obsidian's panel) and an optional per-type
  body template — extending the existing "template section writes empty hidden
  props" behaviour to whole-note creation.
- **Considerations.** Per-type body template stored either in settings or as a
  pointer to a vault template file (the D2 layout-store folder is a natural
  home); if core Templates / Templater is present, insert into the flow rather
  than fight it; configurable target folder and naming.
- **Barriers.** Overlap and ordering conflicts with existing template plugins;
  where the body template lives (vault file vs. settings blob); frontmatter key
  ordering on creation.
- **Touchpoints.** `core/settings.ts` (per-type template ref); `main.ts` (command +
  palette); `core/note-model.ts` (create + initial write).
- **Steps.** Per-type template config → create-note command → write hidden props →
  optional body insert → folder / naming options.

### Milestone 15 — Value history & richer conflicts ○ (target v4.2)

**Goal.** Extend L1's trust story from *configuration* to *data*.
**Done when.** Every property write can be traced and restored per note
(capped journal); conflicts both sides changed get a real merge UI instead of
only keep-mine / take-theirs; inline chips decrypt via the session unlock.

#### L2 — Value history & richer conflict handling ○ (L)

- **What.** A capped per-note history of property-value writes with a restore
  picker; a real merge UI for the conflicts that today fall back to the
  keep-mine / take-theirs prompt; and decryption support for the inline
  `prop:` / `val:` chips (the sidebar masks and unlocks today, the chips do
  not).
- **Considerations.** Since v3.7.1 every value write funnels through
  `NoteModel`/`NoteFacade` and both flush on unload — journal per-note diffs
  from that one seam (capped and compacted) rather than adding a second write
  path, and the journal can't lose tail writes. The merge UI reuses the field
  list the conflict guard already computes. Chip decryption reuses the
  existing `core/secure.ts` session unlock; no new key handling. Build only
  after F6 (Milestone 12) has the seam under test.
- **Barriers.** History storage growth (cap + compaction policy — and it
  belongs in its own file, following the v3.8.0 roll-history precedent, not in
  `data.json`); encrypted values must be journaled as envelopes, never
  plaintext; merge-UI scope creep — it only needs the keys both sides changed.
- **Touchpoints.** `core/note-model.ts` (write journal); `core/snapshot-store.ts`;
  `core/merge.ts` plus a new modal in `ui/modals/`;
  `features/inline/inline-render.ts` + `core/secure.ts`.
- **Steps.** Capped write journal (own file) → per-note history panel +
  restore → merge modal for both-sides conflicts → inline chip unlock.

*L1 — history & safe sync — shipped in v3.1.0 (see Trust & safe sync above);
its recorded future extensions are exactly this milestone.*

### Milestone 16 — Interaction polish ○ (any release)

**Goal.** Finish M1's two deferrals and unlock the disabled dice AA.
**Done when.** Dense sheets navigate with one Tab stop per entry (arrows move
within); a bundled high-contrast preset ships; the 3D-dice anti-alias toggle
is re-enabled with an approach that survives CSS 3D.

#### M1 — Accessibility completion ✅ (shipped in v3.6.0)

Delivered every step. **ARIA audit:** each custom control maps to a native role
and name — editable value cells are focusable `role="button"`s, the rating is a
`role="slider"` (arrow keys + Home/End), the custom slider keeps its slider
value semantics, native checkboxes carry accessible names, list chips expose a
labelled *Remove* button, section titles are `aria-expanded` disclosures, and the
entry `⋯` menu, steppers and roll buttons are labelled. **Keyboard editing:**
values open with Enter/Space (not only via the context menu), the checkbox toggles
from the keyboard even in locked mode, and rating/slider adjust with the arrows.
**Reduced motion:** honoured across the roll / spin / collapse animations (the 3D
die lands without the spin). **High contrast:** a `forced-colors: active` block
plus broader `:focus-visible` rings ensure no state is conveyed by colour alone
under Windows High Contrast. **Manual pass:** the screen-reader / keyboard test
checklist lives in [ACCESSIBILITY.md](ACCESSIBILITY.md). *Future:* an in-entry
arrow-key composite (fewer Tab stops on dense sheets) and a full high-contrast
theme preset.

#### M2 — Dense-sheet keyboard composite & high-contrast preset ○ (M)

- **What.** The two items M1 left as future work: a roving-tabindex composite
  *inside* an entry's control cluster (arrow keys move within a cluster, Tab
  moves between entries) so dense sheets stop costing one Tab stop per
  control, and a bundled high-contrast theme preset over the `--ep-*`
  variable surface. (The type table got its separate keyboard pass in v3.8.0
  — this item is now purely the sidebar composite plus the preset.)
- **Considerations.** Follow the ARIA toolbar/grid composite patterns; build
  on `utils/a11y.ts` and E1's existing *entry-level* roving tabindex — the
  new composite nests inside it (entry level ↔ control level), and that
  nesting is the design risk to prototype first. The preset ships as a Style
  Settings profile — no new theming machinery.
- **Barriers.** Nested roving focus coexisting with Obsidian's own focus
  handling and the virtualized table view; needs a screen-reader pass
  (update the ACCESSIBILITY.md checklist), not just keyboard testing.
- **Touchpoints.** `ui/render/section-renderer.ts`, `ui/render/entry-renderer.ts`,
  `ui/render/cluster.ts`; `utils/a11y.ts`; `styles.css`; ACCESSIBILITY.md.
- **Steps.** Composite prototype in the sidebar → extend across entry kinds →
  high-contrast preset → re-run and update the manual a11y checklist.

#### R1 — 3D dice anti-aliasing, second attempt ○ (S–M)

- **What.** Re-approach the anti-aliasing that shipped in v3.5.0 and was
  locked off in v3.5.2: the 2× supersample distorted the dice under CSS 3D.
  Goal: smooth face edges without geometry distortion, then re-enable the
  settings toggle.
- **Considerations.** Candidate approaches, roughly cheapest first: a subtle
  same-colour border / edge inset on each face polygon to soften the
  silhouette; uniform `scale3d` supersampling with corrected perspective (the
  v3.5.1 lesson — every axis must scale and the perspective origin must
  compensate); or pre-rendering the solid to canvas. Prototype behind a dev
  flag and compare screenshots before committing.
- **Barriers.** CSS 3D + supersampling interact with z-depth and perspective
  in ways that broke twice already — this needs visual-regression
  screenshots, not eyeballing; GPU cost on mobile; the reduced-motion path
  must stay untouched.
- **Touchpoints.** `features/rolling/dice-styles.ts`, `dice-anim.ts`;
  `utils/polyhedra.ts` (per-face insets if that route wins); `styles.css`.
- **Steps.** Prototype 2–3 approaches behind a dev flag → screenshot
  comparison → pick (possibly per-platform) → re-enable the toggle → record
  the outcome here.

### Milestone 17 — Ecosystem & community listing ○ (ongoing)

**Goal.** Make the plugin easy to discover and easy to extend.
**Done when.** The plugin is listed in Obsidian's community directory, and a
third-party module can contribute a settings panel, a command and a value-type
editor without forking.

#### P1 — Community plugin directory listing ○ (M)

- **What.** Submit to `obsidianmd/obsidian-releases` per the runbook in
  [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) §4: public repo, published (non-draft) release
  with the three assets, then the `community-plugins.json` PR and review.
- **Considerations.** BRAT already serves beta users, so there is no urgency
  pressure — but review queues run weeks to months, so submit early relative
  to Milestone 13 rather than waiting for the flagship. Target right after
  Milestone 12: the stability story (bench + seam tests + the v3.7.x/3.8.0
  hardening run) is the best reviewer-facing evidence. Split the README
  (~30 KB single file) into a quick start and a reference before submitting —
  reviewers and new users both benefit.
- **Barriers.** Guideline review will likely flag: the
  `window.ExtendedProperties` global (needed for the cross-plugin API —
  prepare the rationale; an `app.plugins`-based access path already exists as
  the documented alternative), the two guarded private-API call sites
  (`metadataTypeManager`, `commands.removeCommand`), and mobile behaviour —
  `isDesktopOnly: false` claims phone support, so a real mobile QA pass is a
  prerequisite, not a nice-to-have.
- **Touchpoints.** README (split); `manifest.json` (optional `fundingUrl`);
  `.github/workflows/release.yml` (already tag-triggered);
  `community-plugins.json` PR.
- **Steps.** Self-review against the plugin guidelines → mobile QA pass on a
  phone vault → README split → publish a non-draft release → submit the PR →
  respond to review (expect at least one round).

#### K1 — API v2 & module ecosystem ○ (L, ongoing)

- **What.** Grow the public API into richer contribution points: module-supplied
  settings panels, palette commands, inline tokens and value-type editors; a
  module template repo; and more bundled optional modules (other RPG systems,
  habit / fitness / recipe trackers).
- **Considerations.** v3.8.0's `ClusterAddon.onRename` is the working pattern:
  optional members on existing contracts grow the API *without* bumping
  `apiVersion`. Keep accreting that way and reserve the v2 bump for a
  genuinely breaking change. Contribution points stay declarative (modules
  describe what they add); the registry already isolates module errors and
  reserves built-in ids.
- **Barriers.** Balancing API stability against growth; Obsidian does not sandbox
  plugin code, so third-party modules run with full trust (document this
  loudly); maintenance burden of every bundled module.
- **Touchpoints.** `src/api.ts`; `core/registry.ts`; `ui/settings-tab.ts` (module
  panels); docs.
- **Steps.** Settings-panel + command contribution points → inline-token hook →
  value-type editor hook → publish a module template repo → bump `apiVersion`
  to 2 only when a breaking change forces it.

### Deliberately not planned

Boundaries, so the backlog stays a plan rather than a wish list:

- **A full query DSL.** G1 stays a declarative block schema with a handful of
  keys; Dataview owns the free-grammar space, and the differentiator here is
  typed, *editable* cells.
- **Sandboxing third-party modules.** Obsidian does not sandbox plugins, so
  pretending modules are contained would be security theatre — K1 documents
  the full-trust model loudly instead.
- **A WYSIWYG layout designer** beyond the existing drag & drop, templates and
  options modals.
- **Note-body storage.** Frontmatter stays the single data home; the plugin
  reads bodies never, writes them only for explicit exports (roll history) and
  H2's opt-in scaffolding.
- **Multi-writer real-time sync.** The three-way merge, snapshots and (L2)
  value history are the collaboration story; live co-editing is Obsidian's
  problem, not a plugin's.
